This product is for Hackathon at my university. I wrote the backend on Golang, but it wasn't released, and I did [the final presentation](https://speakerdeck.com/azurata09/suggit) (This is Japanese).

Our team got [3rd place](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ENyzO4otZ5C_uP1UcBkHLx35joj_33RBoAp8GtFZ_6k/edit?usp=sharing).

## BreakAll

This is by my hobby to create plugin of [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org). I want to use this for somewhere server.

This makes it when players break blocks with an appropriate tool, break neighbor same blocks.
